Instagram Account Checker 
========= 
 
This is a little python script which checks if a Instagram account is taken or not. 
 
Because of the way Instagram works with reserved usernames this isn't 100% accurate.

Uses Queues to speed up how long it takes to check a list of usernames.

It took around 9 minutes to complete a list of 2500 usernames:

It defaults to a file called "Account.txt" if that can't be found then it will use sys.args
